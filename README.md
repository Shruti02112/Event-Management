This project is an Event Management Website that allows event organizers to easily manage and track their events. The website provides an intuitive interface for both organizers and participants. Below are the key features of the project:

User Authentication: Event organizers can sign in securely to access and manage their events.
Event Management: Organizers can add, edit, or delete events through a simple dashboard. They can input key details like event name, date, time, venue, and description.
Homepage Display: All available events are displayed on the homepage, with full event details visible to users. Each event includes a registration button that redirects participants to the registration form.
Participant Registration: Visitors can register for events by providing their details. Upon successful registration, participants receive a unique ticket that confirms their participation in the event.
Database Integration: The backend uses SQL for efficient data storage and retrieval. Event data and participant registration information are stored in a relational database, ensuring data integrity.
Flask Backend: Built with Flask, the web framework handles user authentication, event management, and participant registration logic.
